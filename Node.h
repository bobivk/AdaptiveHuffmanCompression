Tree must have the following invariants:
-Each node has a sibling
-Node's with higher weights have higher orders
-On each level, the node farthest to the right will have the highest order although there might be other nodes with equal weight
-Leaf nodes contain character values, except the Not Yet Transmitted(NYT) node which is the node whereat all new characters are added
-Internal nodes contain weights equal to the sum of their children's weights
-All nodes of the same weight will be in consecutive order.

Before updating, we search for the highest ordered node with the same weight as soon-to-be-updated node.
If found, we swap the two
Then we increment the weight and go up the tree incrementing the weight of all of its parents.
